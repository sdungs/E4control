# E4control v1.7.1
E4control is a python based software for device controlling and data taking.

It consists of two packages: **devices** and **scripts**.

The device classes can be used in any Python environment to establish a communication link and to execute commands, but the easiest way to perform measurements is to run one of the scripts provided.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
To use e4control, Python is needed. To ease installation, [pip for Python](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) is also needed.

Please note that the software is only tested with Python 3 & pip3, although it may work with Python 2 as well. But at least the SHT sensor requires Python 3 to run.

### Installation procedure
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open a terminal and change directory to E4control.
3. For installation enter: `pip install .` (Ensure python3/pip3 usage!)
4. *(add PATH to .bashrc)*

### How to use the SHT75 Temperature & Humidity Sensor
0. A Raspberry Pi is required for read-out.
1. Install the latest version of E4control also on the Pi. Default path is *~/software/* (otherwise see 3.)
2. Connect the SHT75 to the corresponding pins of the Pi. Check [SHT_Server](/e4control/devices/SHT_Server.py) for some information on the pin configuration.
3. Ensure the ssh connection by adjusting the __init__ function in [SHT75 class](e4control/devices/SHT75.py). This may include copying the ssh-key to the Pi in order to get rid of the necessity to manually type in the password, changing the default shell to bash and making StartServer.sh executable. Default username is *labuser*. If the path is differing from the default, it needs to adapted in [StartServer.sh](/e4control/devices/StartServer.sh), as well.

Running E4control directly on the Pi is possible. The config should read:
` T SHT75 lan localhost 50000 1`

## How to run scripts?
If -h or --help is supplied at the command line, the basic usage of the script will be explained, printing a short explanation of each argument.

#### config file
A config file with all used devices is needed for every script. For an example see [exampleConfig](/examples/exampleConfig).
In the first column the purpose of the respective device is written (S = source meter, L = LCR meter, T = temperature device, H = humidity device, C = cooling device). The other columns contain device name, connection type, host and port. The columns are separated by a single space.

A line is ignored if it has '#' as its first character.

#### e4control_measure_IV
To measure the current against voltage, enter:
`e4control_measure_IV V_min V_max output config -I I_lim -s V_steps -n ndaqs -d delay -noLivePlot -db database`

- V_min   -> starting voltage | float | in V
- V_max   -> end voltage | float | in V
- output  -> output directory name | string
- config  -> config file name | string

- V_steps -> number of voltage steps | int
- ndaqs   -> number of data acquistion at every set voltage | int
- delay   -> delay after setting new voltage | int | in s
- noLivePlot-> hide live plot | flag
- database-> enable pixel database output | flag

example:
`e4control_measure_IV 0 100 meas_1 config_IV -I 3 -s 11 -n 5 -d 2 `

#### e4control_measure_CV

`e4control_measure_CV V_min V_max output config -s V_steps -n ndaqs -d delay -f lcr_frequency -p noLivePlot -db database`

- V_min   -> starting voltage | float | in V
- V_max   -> end voltage | float | in V

 -->
#### e4control_measure_It
To measure the current against time at a fixed voltage, enter:
`e4control_measure_It output config -v voltage -n ndaqs -d delay -p noLivePlot -db database`

- voltage -> constant set voltage | float | in V

*this measurement runs until ctrl+C is pressed*
